# latex-vscode-snippets
Some code snippets to use in VSCode for LaTeX and Markdown. 
Feel free to suggest improvements!

### What LaTeX packages should I use?
Some recommended packages are:
```
\usepackage{graphicx, amsmath, amssymb, amsthm}
\usepackage[ruled, vlined, linesnumbered]{algorithm2e}
```

### Why are there no tab stops?
When typing in VSCode, if there is an autocomplete suggestion, pressing TAB will insert the suggested code instead of moving to the next tab stop.
